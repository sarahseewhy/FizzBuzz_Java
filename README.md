####Practicing FizzBuzz in Java

This is a simple kata that prints out the multiples of three, five, and fifteen as "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" respectively.

I use this kata to get a handle on TDD and the syntax of a new language, in this case Java.

In my first iteration of the kata there's still a good bit of repetition which I'd like to refactor. It's a start.
